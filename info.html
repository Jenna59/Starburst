        <p class="left">Starburst&#174; is a Mars Wrigley Confectionery brand.</p>
        <p class="left">Established in the UK in the 1960s with the brand name of OPAL FRUITS&#174;, the original flavours were strawberry, orange, lemon, and lime.</p>
        <p class="left">When OPAL FRUITS&#174; headed to America in 1967 the Starburst&#174; name was introduced there. It was not until 1998 that the OPAL FRUITS&#174; name was completely phased out in Ireland and the UK and Starburst&#174 became the global brand name.</p>
        <p class="left">While the product line is most likely known for its iconic Starburst&#174; Fruit Chews, it has expanded over the years to include: jellybeans, candy canes, GummiBursts&#174;, and Starburst&#174; Minis.</p>
